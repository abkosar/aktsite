Cell Biologist and Postdoctoral Scientist with over 9 years of research experience on non-coding RNAs and cellular degradation mechanisms (different autophagy pathways) in health and disease states such as Parkinsonâ€™s Disease.  

My scientific approach is well grounded and detail-oriented, it has matured through my intense PhD and postdoctoral training during which I have published multiple manuscripts, contributed to grants, and mentored several trainees. Furthermore, I have collaborated with numerous international teams and biotech companies during these years. 

Some of my strengths are excellence in laboratory and project management, critical thinking, rigorous planning and timely advancement towards measurable outcomes.

I define myself as an intuitive and insightful person who contributes significantly to optimization and improvement of the organization as well as my personal growth.
