      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cell Biologist and Postdoctoral Scientist with over 9 years of research experience on non-coding RNAs and cellular degradation mechanisms (different autophagy pathways) in health and disease states such as Parkinsonâ€™s Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My scientific approach is well grounded and detail-oriented, it has matured through my intense PhD and postdoctoral training during which I have published multiple manuscripts, contributed to grants, and mentored several trainees. Furthermore, I have collaborated with numerous international teams and biotech companies during these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my strengths are excellence in laboratory and project management, critical thinking, rigorous planning and timely advancement towards measurable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I define myself as an intuitive and insightful person who contributes significantly to optimization and improvement of the organization as well as my personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
